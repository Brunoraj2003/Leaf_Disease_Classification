🍃 Mango Leaf Disease Classification
📌 Overview
This project focuses on classifying mango leaf diseases using computer vision techniques. By leveraging object detection models like YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, the system identifies and categorizes different diseases affecting mango leaves, enabling early intervention for better crop health management.

🏆 Features
✅ Automated detection of six mango leaf diseases
✅ Utilizes YOLOv5 & YOLOv8 for object detection
✅ High-accuracy classification using polygon labeling
✅ Scalable for integration with mobile or IoT-based monitoring

📂 Dataset
The dataset comprises labeled images of mango leaves in different health conditions, sourced from:
📌 Kaggle Datasets: Dataset 1, Dataset 2
📌 Manual Image Collection: Captured real-world images of infected leaves

Diseases Identified

Anthracnose
Powdery Mildew
Sooty Mold
Gall Midge
Die Back
Bacterial Canker
Healthy Leaves
🚀 Model Training & Evaluation
The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets. Two models were trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

✅ YOLOv8 outperforms YOLOv5 in accuracy, making it suitable for high-performance applications.

🛠️ Installation
To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
PyTorch
Ultralytics YOLO (pip install ultralytics)

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/mango-leaf-disease
cd mango-leaf-disease
pip install -r requirements.txt

🔥 Usage
Training the Model
